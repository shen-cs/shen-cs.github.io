Education
======
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, 2019
* M.S. in Communication Engineering, Nation Taiwan University, 2021
* PhD in imec, Belgium (ongoing)

Research experience
======
* **Circular array for switched-beam radar for UAVs**, Jun. 2019 - Sep. 2021
  * Advisor: Prof. Shih-Yuan Chen (Collaboration with Prof. Kun-You Lin of NTU) 
  * Designed circular phased array capable of scanning over a 2D plane without severe beam distortion for UAV object avoidance system application.
  * Built models and analyzing simulation results with HFSS and MATLAB frequently.


* **Metamaterial-based antenna design**, Jun. 2019 - Sep. 2021
  * Designed metamaterial that has a near-zero refractive index to enhance the beamwidth and gain of a quasi-yagi antenna.
  * The antenna was later used as circular array element.


Work Experience
=====
* **Hardware Validation Intern - Intel, Taipei**, Sep. 2017 - Jul 2018
  * Supported RF engineers on wireless communication module validation team about measurement test reports, and also developed software tools powered by Python for test automation with other interns.
* **Hardware Engineering Intern - Google, Taipei**, Jul. 2020 - Oct 2020
  * Designed dual band, dual polarization mmWave phased array antenna for 5G smartphone with large bandwidth, high gain, and high coverage. Developed software automation tools to automate HFSS software.
* **Research Assistant - Academia Sinica, Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Taipei**, Sep. 2021ÔºçMar 2022
  * Designed a 200 - 800 MHz log-periodic dipole antenna with high directivity for Fast Radio Burst (FRB) detection.
  *	Designed the system blocks for FRB detection system with low noise temperature.
